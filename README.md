## CodeIgniter3.1-starter1

This project can be used as a starter for a webapp built with CodeIgniter 3.1.

The [user guide](http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/) has been removed, 
as it can be accessed online.

Additionally, **index.php** has been moved to a **public** folder, and a
**.htaccess** file added there, for improved security. 

**index.php** has been modified to reference the correct relative location 
of CodeIgniter's **system** and **application** folders.
The **application/config/config.php** configuration has been modified with
defaults for the *base_url* and *index_page* config settings.

Configure your web server or virtual host so that your project's
document root maps to this **public** folder inside your project.
